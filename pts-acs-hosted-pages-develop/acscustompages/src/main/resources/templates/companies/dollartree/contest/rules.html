				<p><strong>WINNER SELECTION</strong><br>
				Between June 6 through June 17, ten (10) potential winners will be selected at random from among all eligible entries received. The odds of being selected as a potential winner depend on the number of eligible entries received. Winners will be announced by July 1, 2022. </p>

				<p><strong>HOW TO CLAIM PRIZE</strong><br>
				Potential winners will be notified via email through email address supplied during the Promotion entry and will be asked to provide their full name, age, and mailing address within a specific time period. Prizes will be mailed within three (3) weeks of receipt of winner&rsquo;s details. If a potential winner cannot be contacted within three (3) days of the first attempt to contact him/her, or does not respond within the timeframe stated in the notification, Dollar Tree may select an alternate potential winner in his/her place. Winners that cannot be contacted within the allotted timeframe will no longer be eligible to claim the prize. </p>

				<p><strong>PRIVACY AND PUBLICITY</strong><br>
				Dollar Tree will collect personal data from Entrants, and this information may be used for the purposes of administering the Promotion, publicizing the Promotion (including in connection with the announcement of winners), and otherwise in accordance with the Dollar Tree Privacy Policy (available at https://www.dollartree.com/privacy-policy). Unless prohibited by law, participation in the Promotion constitutes each Entrant&rsquo;s consent for Dollar Tree to use the Entrant&rsquo;s name (or username), age, hometown, and state of residence for promotional purposes worldwide, in any media now known or later developed, without additional payment or consideration to the Entrant. </p>

				<p><strong>GENERAL RELEASE AND WAIVER OF CLAIMS</strong><br>
				By participating in the Promotion, each Entrant agrees (for himself/herself and his/her heirs) to release and hold harmless the Promotion Entities and each such company&rsquo;s respective officers, directors, employees, and agents (collectively, the &ldquo;Released Parties&rdquo;) from and against any claim or cause of action arising out of participation in the Promotion or receipt or use of any prize, including, but not limited to: (1) unauthorized human intervention in the Promotion; (b) technical or printing errors; (c) lost, late, postage-due, garbled, illegible, misdirected or undeliverable mail or email; (d) errors in the administration of the Promotion or the processing of entries; or (e) injury or damage to persons or property which may be caused directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, from participation in the Promotion or receipt or use of any prize.

				<p><strong>DISPUTES</strong><br>
